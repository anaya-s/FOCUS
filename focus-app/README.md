# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Guide

- `node_modules` - storage folder that holds your *React package* along with *other packages* that might be installed as you work on your React project. The `node` module helps configure the design system of your React project.

- `src` - stores in all the *files and components* used in your react application ranging from the App.js, index.js, App.css. 

- `package-lock.json` - locks the versions of dependencies your React project uses, and this helps in managing dependencies in your React project.

## Installing packages

```bash
npm install <package-name>
```
